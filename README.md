# poultry-helper
This is poultry helper app. 

Farmers are the base of our country , Beside farming some farmers also do the business like grocery shop, fish farming , poultry farming etc.. 

So basically in poultry farming , a contractor gives some chicks to the farmer and take it back on the duration of 35-40 days, and then the contractor will do the payment on the basis of poultry fcr, death ratio , feed consumed , weight of the chick etc.. This requires sometimes complex calculation if we see from the farmer's angle. 

So for making all this process easy and user friendly for the farmer I had developed an app which will ultimately help the farmer in efficient way. It has a portal for farmers to ask and resolve the query they have. Also it contains GUI to find the estimated FCR, total weight, total feed consumed etc.. by their own.
